Example server (https://github.com/maitkin/react-play-server)


## Prerequisites

   node >= 7.4.0

## Running

   Edit API_URL in .env accordingly (should point to example server)
   
   npm install

   npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev

   npm start


## Notes

   You may need to setup your paths such that webpack-dev-server is in it, or
   change the configuration to point to the correct location (.e.g. node_modules/.bin)
